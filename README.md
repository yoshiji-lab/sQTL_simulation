# Analytic Power Curves for sQTL / GWAS

This repository contains a single Jupyter notebook (`power_curve_demo.ipynb`) that uses a closed-form formula to plot statistical power under a genome-wide significance threshold (e.g. Bonferroni or BH-equivalent). No external data or Monte-Carlo simulations are required.
